## waved

_waved_ is aimed at becoming a userspace driver for the reMarkableÂ 2 E-Ink controller.

**Disclaimer: This is still a prototype. Use at your own risk.**

### Demo

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1370040/130524775-c99bc205-9c89-48a3-8a53-34033976a469.mp4

### Building

Pre-built binaries are available from the [releases page](https://github.com/matteodelabre/waved/releases).\
To compile the demo from the [base](https://github.com/toltec-dev/toolchain/pkgs/container/base) Toltec Docker image with the source mounted in `/host`:

```sh
cmake \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/usr/share/cmake/arm-linux-gnueabihf.cmake \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -S /host -B /host/build
cmake --build /host/build --verbose
```

After the build completes, resulting binaries can be found inside the `build` directory. Those include the `libwaved` shared library, the `waved-demo` binary used to run visual tests, and the `waved-dump` binary that can be used to print information about a WBF file.
